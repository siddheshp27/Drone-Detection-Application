# Drone-Detection-Application

This project was developed using the Python-based Django framework.

We have created a custom dataset drones (UAVs)
and other flying objects like birds, planes and more
and labeled it. Then, using YOLOv5, we trained a model to identify the above objects and distinguish them from drones.
This is done in various light and weather conditions
and distances. A GUI is also proposed for 
user-friendly experience which does successful
detection locally on images, videos and in real time.


This Project was made using Python, YOLOv5, Tkinter.
